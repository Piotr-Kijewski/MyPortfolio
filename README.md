# My Portfolio

## Welcome

Hello everyone who decided to visit my GitHub profile and learn a little more about me.

Due to the fact that I am not a developer, I hope that people who read this will appreciate my work that I put into this project to show my skills.

Thanks to GitHub and Visual Studio Code, you can learn more about me in an interesting and accessible form.

ðŸš€ Greetings to everyone who reads this and have a nice day. ðŸš€

Piotr Kijewski
